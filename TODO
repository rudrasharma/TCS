Java TMCS TODOs:

  1. Create textual output of entire running state of the system per simulation
     loop. (Nearly Complete)
  2. Handle case where two submit journeys events in the same simulation
     loop start at the same start station.
  3. Handle time duration of close route and station events.
  4. Understand ChangeLight(...) system output event.
     a. Need to implement
     b. Possibly change the event system to using observer pattern with
        listeners instead of pushing the events via method calls to system map.
     
Alloy Model TODOs:
  1. Possibly order routes.
